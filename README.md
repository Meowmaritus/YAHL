# YAHL:
Yet Another Havok Lib

# DISAPPOINTMENT:
* Does not support writing yet.
* Does not support parsing the DATA section using the TYPE and INDX sections yet.
* Sucks.

# CLONING:
* Use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Meowmaritus/YAHL.git` to ensure submodule SoulsFormats is cloned as well.
